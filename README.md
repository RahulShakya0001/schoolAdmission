📚 College Management System – Project Overview
Hey there! 😊
Welcome to the College Management System – a simple yet powerful web-based project built with love ❤️ to help manage everything from student records to attendance and homework in an organized way. Let me walk you through what this system does and how it works!

👤 Admin Panel (The Heart of the System)
Only the Admin has full access to manage everything in the system:

✅ Add Students

✅ Add Teachers

✅ Add Subjects

✅ Add Classes

✅ Mark Attendance (for any student)

✅ Submit Student Fees

✅ Generate & Print Student ID Cards

🛑 Important: If you want a teacher or student to log in, their entry must be added first by the admin. Without this step, login won’t work for them.

👨‍🏫 Teacher Login (Role-Based Access)
Once logged in, a teacher can:

📌 Mark attendance – for students who are in their class and subject

📝 Give homework – to the students they teach

🧑‍🎓 Student Login (Personal Dashboard)
When a student logs in, they can:

📋 View homework – assigned by their teacher

💰 View their fee status

📄 Check their profile info

🔐 Note: Students cannot update their own fee info. Only the admin can do that from the backend.

🎁 Extra Features
🆔 Student ID Card printing

📊 Clean and organized user interface

🔐 Role-based login system

🧠 Easy to use for everyone!

🔚 Final Note
This project is not just about features—it's about making things easier for students, teachers, and admin staff. I hope you enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed building it! 😊
Thank you so much for checking it out. 🙏
